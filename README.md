# WOD Twist

This project is my final project at BrainStation (Software Engineering Bootcamp).

Students were given the freedom to use any technology they had acquired during the program and the flexibility to explore and acquire new skills as the project demanded.

On September 7th, 2023, students presented their project to the public, with hiring managers, friends, and family coming together to witness the results of their hard work and innovation.

Technologies and npm packages used:

- React
- JavaScript
- Firebase
- HTML5
- Sass
- dotenv
- Chart.js
- React-router-dom

## Project Inspiration

I was inspired to create WOD Twist because I'm a naturally competitive person and enjoy fitness. I thought it would be interesting to pair users so that they can compete against each other in a workout where they played a role in tailoring the movements.

My motivation behind creating WOD Twist stemmed from competitive nature and my passion for fitness. I found it interesting to connect users, allowing them to engage in friendly competition where they could actively contribute to customizing the workout.

Users are able to queue up by pressing the middle icon (Match Icon) in Home. The icon will change to a loading icon signifying that it is waiting for another user. Once another user is also queued, the matchmaking process will commence.
