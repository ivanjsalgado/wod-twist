# WOD Twist

This project is my final project at BrainStation (Software Engineering Bootcamp).

Students were given the freedom to use any technology they had acquired during the program and the flexibility to explore and acquire new skills as the project demanded.

On September 7th, 2023, students presented their project to the public, with hiring managers, friends, and family coming together to witness the results of their hard work and innovation.

Technologies and npm packages used:

- React
- JavaScript
- Firebase
- HTML5
- Sass
- dotenv
- Chart.js
- React-router-dom

## Project Inspiration

My motivation behind creating WOD Twist stemmed from competitive nature and my passion for fitness. I found it interesting to connect users, allowing them to engage in friendly competition where they could actively contribute to customizing the workout.

## Test the Application Using Firebase Deployment

The application's design was tailored for mobile devices with a viewport width close to 400px.

Open https://fir-login-a156c.web.app/ to view it in your browser.

Enter Inspect Mode and change the viewport width to 400px.

You can use the following email and password to enter if you don't have time to create a login:

Email: try@try.com

Password: 123456

If you do create a new account, importing a photo is not necessary. The user will be given a default profile photo. The alert "Account has been successfully created" will display once the database has been updated. This email and password is your login.

Users are able to queue up by pressing the middle icon (Match Icon) in Home. The icon will change to a loading icon signifying that it is waiting for another user. Once another user is also queued, the matchmaking process will commence.
